# Automatic Test Case Generation from Software Requirements

## Overview
This repository contains code for automatically generating test cases from software requirements using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Automatically generate test cases from natural language requirements.
- Utilizes NLP techniques for understanding requirements.
- Includes machine learning models for predicting test cases based on requirements.
- Provides tools for evaluating model performance and accuracy.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/automatic-test-case-generation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd auto-testcase-generation

3. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
-Prepare your software requirements in a text file or format.
-Train the machine learning model using the provided scripts or pre-trained models.
-Use the trained model to predict test cases for new requirements.
-Evaluate the model's performance using provided evaluation tools.
